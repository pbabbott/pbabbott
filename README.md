<img align="right" width="250" src="./assets/brandon_profile.JPG" alt="Brandon Abbott" />

<blockquote>

I am a software engineer based in Saint Paul, MN, with a passion for writing efficient code and fostering team success. With over a decade of professional experience since 2010, I specialize in designing robust architectures, implementing DevOps best practices, and continuously improving my skills. I have a strong commitment to writing high-quality code and collaborating with others to achieve optimal results.

Outside of work, I maintain a small homelab to practice and explore new technologies.  I've been using Ansible to manage my infrastructure via the repository [`home-playbooks`](https://github.com/pbabbott/home-playbooks).  Within this infra and hosted services, my custom web apps live are managed by the monorepo: [`home-web-apps`](https://github.com/pbabbott/home-web-apps). These experiences have not only improved my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in project management and system scalability.

When I'm not at the keyboard, I enjoy connecting with family, playing video games, and cooking. I moved back home to Seattle with my wife Marie in 2016 to be closer to my family and then to Saint Paul, MN, in 2023 to live closer to Marie's family after having two children. In my free time, I love playing factory-simulation games like Satisfactory, Factorio, & Dyson Sphere Program, which fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills. I also enjoy shooters like Call of Duty, Halo, Battlefield, among others. Cooking Mexican and Korean cuisine is another passion of mine, as I find joy in sharing great food and connecting with others. At my grooms party just before my wedding, I cooked a Mexican feast for nearly 35 guests, a memorable experience that highlights my love for both cooking and bringing people together.
